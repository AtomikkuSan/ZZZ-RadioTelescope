Radio Astronomy Telescope
============================

ZZZ Industries in cooperation with MunSeeker Artisanal Devices

A new type of large radio telescope that can be packed into a small volume and deployed at remote locations. Contains a small SAS for stability control. 

The receiver needs 5 units electrical charge per second. Provides science reports.

The model and texturing is from the always excellent zzz originally as part of a microwave receiver, the part.cfg for the radio telescope is from Munseeker. zzz released his model into the public domain and graciously gave me written permission to use as part of this mod.
